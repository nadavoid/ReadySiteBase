Tag options enhance the applicability of Linodef tags and make them expandable without the need for changing their structure. There are two kinds of options:
<ul>
<li>element type: assigns an element type to the tag ID</li>
<li>modification: manipulates the way how the tag is substituted</li>
</ul>
Regarding the <a href="&base_url&filter/tips#linodef">usage of the options</a> there are no differences between element type options and modification options.

Some options need a value. They are assigned the following way:
<pre>option="value"</pre>
Value may contain all 8-bit characters except <em>]</em> and <em>"</em>.

The following options are available:
<h4>Element types</h4>
<dl>
<dt>nid</dt>
<dd>ID refers to a node (optional, always active if other ID types not set). ID = node ID (number).</dd>
<dt>tid</dt>
<dd>ID refers to a taxonomy term. ID = term id (number).</dd>
<dt>viewid</dt>
<dd>ID refers to a view. ID = viewname (alphanumeric).</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Embed modifications</h4>
For all element types:
<dl>
<dt>nolink</dt>
<dd>The embedded element is not linked.</dd>
<dt>linktext="%text"</dt>
<dd>Instead of the node title, taxonomy term, field value etc this custom text will be linked. This option replaces the old Linodef tag &lt;#nid&gt;%text&lt;/#&gt; which is now deprecated.</dd>
For element type <em>node</em> (nid):
<dt>translation="%language"</dt>
<dd>If the embedded node has a translation in the specified language than the translated node is embedded instead. Senseful if you embed a node which has no translated node yet but you want to embed the translated node as soon as it is created.
    As value use the abbrevation of the language. Often a Drupal language uses the abbrevation defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO 639-1/2</a>, e.g. translation="de".</dd>
</dl>
For element type <em>view</em> (viewid):
<dt>viewtitle</dt>
<dd>Only the viewtitle with a link to the view will be embedded. The link heeds the values for <em>viewdisplay</em> and <em>viewargs</em>.
    <em>By default the embedded view is not linked to itself,</em> because a view contains HTML block tags what would cause a weird output if surrounded with an inline link tag. So if you would like to embed and have a link to the view then use a second tag with this option.</dd>
<dt>viewdisplay="%display"</dt>
<dd>Choose the view display that will be shown. If the input type Linodef is part of uses a HTML filter then <em>make sure that those HTML tags used by the view are allowed by the HTML filter</em>, e.g. &lt;table&gt; for view displays using a table. Otherwise the embedded view will look weird.</dd>
<dt>viewargs="%arguments"</dt>
<dd>Arguments passed to the view. Separate them by <em>&amp;</em>, e.g. viewargs="Satyr&amp;Pan&amp;Faunus&amp;Centaur".</dd>
