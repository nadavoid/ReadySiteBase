Linodef tags support comments. Comments are for those who want to get a better idea of the purpose of a Linodef tag during editing. Therefore the comment has the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>it is only visible while editing a node</li>
<li>it is not loaded when viewing a node so no one is able to see the comment by viewing a node</li>
<li>it may contain any UTF-8 character except <strong>]</strong></li>
</ul>
