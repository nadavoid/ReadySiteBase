<em>Linodef</em> provides a <em>buttons API</em> to make the life easy for the ones who want to enable <em>Linodef buttons</em> in their favorite editor which isn't supported by submodules yet.

It is recommended to use the <em>Linodef Buttons - BUEditor module</em> as a template (copy the submodule folder &amp; paste it under a different name) and adjust only the needed things in the .module and the advanced help file and accordingly add or delete required or not required files. If you are not familiar with creating modules for Drupal I recommend to read the documentation about <a href="http://drupal.org/node/231276">creating modules in Drupal 6.x</a>.

The following rules should be heeded while creating an editor support module:
<ol>
<li>The JavaScript file containing the onClick event function must have the name <em>modulename_functions.js</em> and must be located in the modules root folder</li>
<li>The JavaScript function for the onClick event must have the name <em>modulename_onclick</em> and provide one string parameter for the Linodef tag</li>
</ol>

In case you need more information than this documentation provides refer to the <a href="&topic:linodef/structure&">API module itself</a>.
